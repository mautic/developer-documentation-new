# Mautic developer documentation - new

This repository hosts the new developer documentation for Mautic on the [Read the Docs platform][ReadTheDocs]. Merging a PR results in immediate build and deployment to https://mautic-developer.readthedocs.io/

If you're looking for the legacy developer documentation, please go to https://developer.mautic.org/ or the [GitHub repository][Legacy dev docs].

## Migration of developer docs to Read the Docs

The aim is to move all aspects of the developer documentation to Read the Docs.
In the video below, [@dennisameling][dennisameling GH profile] explains how the documentation is currently structured and briefly touches upon current limitations.

For more background, the end goal, and reaching out if you want to help, please review [this issue][New docs background and goals]. Thanks in advance.

## Adding a code sample

Code samples get downloaded from GitHub to ensure that they're always up to date. If you want to add a new code sample, follow these two steps:

1. Create a file in `docs/code_samples/` and add a permalink in there. Look at other files in that directory for examples. URLs should always start with `https://raw.githubusercontent.com/...` to ensure that Sphinx can download the file correctly.
2. In any documentation file, add a `literalinclude` block to include the code, like so:

```
.. The link to this file is defined in docs/code_samples/helloworld_entity_world.py 
.. literalinclude:: ../code_samples_downloaded/Entity_World.php
    :language: php
```

Tip: downloaded files get cached in `docs/code_samples_downloaded` to prevent overloading GitHub with download requests. If you change the URL to a file, simply remove the cached file from `docs/code_samples_downloaded` and Sphinx automatically re-downloads it.

## Build documentation locally

- [RST Syntax Cheatsheet][RST Cheatsheet]
- [Sphinx Demo][Sphinx Demo]
- [Sphinx Syntax][Sphinx Template]

The following provides instructions for how to build docs locally for visualization without pushing to the remote:

1. Install Python 3 for your OS if not already installed
2. Install Sphinx `pip install sphinx`
3. Install sphinx-rtd-theme `pip install sphinx-rtd-theme`
4. CD into the docs directory `cd [path to this repo]/docs`
5. Run `make html`
6. This generates HTML in docs/build/html. Setup a web server with the web root as docs/build/html or open docs/build/html/index.html in a browser.

## Troubleshooting

If the build isn't working for some reason, here's some tips:

- Try running the `make html` command in the terminal: `cd docs && make html`. This command normally provides a lot of additional context.
- If the preview isn't working, click the `esbonio` section in the bottom right corner of the VS Code window. That rebuilds the docs and previews, and tells you if something is wrong.

### Vale
Before pushing, run Vale and address suggestions and errors as applicable.
1. Install [`vale`][Vale] 
2. `vale .`

### PhpStorm/PyCharm File Watcher
You can automatically build changes to .rst files using a file watcher. 
1. Go to Preferences -> Tools -> File Watchers -> + button -> custom
2. Configure the watcher as presented in the screenshot

### Style guide

Please consult Mautic's [`style-guide`][Style guide] before contributing to the documentation. Some rules get enforced through Vale.

As a quick reference, here's the list of headings Mautic uses:

```
H1: ############
H2: ****************
H3: ============
H4: ----------------
H5: ~~~~~~~~~~~~
```

### Converting markdown to reStructuredText

 <!-- vale on -->

Mautic's documentation uses ``reStructuredText``, or ``.rst`` files. Luckily, there's converters available that help you convert ``.md`` to ``.rst`` files. Here's an example of ``m2r`` - this converter also converts tables into ``list-table`` directives properly.

```
pip install m2r
# This creates a new file with the .rst extension:
m2r my_markdown_file.md
```
