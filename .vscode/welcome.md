Welcome to the Mautic developer documentation editor

In this repository, you should already have set up everything you need. To get started, follow these steps:
1. Open a file in the `docs/` folder - files that end with `.rst` are docs files
2. Click the magnifier icon in the top right corner to see a live preview of the file you're editing

Pretty cool, right?

Happy writing :)
