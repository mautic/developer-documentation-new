How to Install Mautic
#####################

Pre-requisites
==================
1 - You must already have Composer available on your computer because this is a development release and you'll need Composer to download the vendor packages. If you don't have Composer, you can download it from http://getcomposer.org.

Installing Mautic is a simple three-step process:
==================

1. Download the repository zip  :ref:`https://github.com/mautic/mautic/archive/refs/heads/features.zip`  then extract the zip to your web root.
2. Run the composer install command to install the required packages.
3. Open your browser and complete the installation through the web installer.
