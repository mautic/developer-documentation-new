Installing, upgrading, and uninstalling
========================================

It is recommended that you register your Plugins with the :ref:`Marketplace`.

Todo: update when Marketplace docs are ready. https://github.com/mautic/mautic/pull/10518

Unsure if the legacy callback methods ``\\Mautic\\PluginBundle\\Bundle\\PluginBundleBase::onPluginInstall`` and ``onPluginUpdate`` will continue to be used in the Marketplace and these are the only supported callbacks at the moment.
